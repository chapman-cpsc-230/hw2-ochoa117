## Description

_\<This assignment prompts us to create a code that satisfies the given information in the instructions.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<Through this exercise, I learned how to use while loops to make a code that accomplishes things that are more complex. Using while loops allowed me to make a table of data for a given time frame.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
